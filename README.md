# Machine Learning with R
This is a series of courses which leads towards the step by step progress in the machine learning. 

The very first step in machine learning is data. 

I am working on the dataset, for that I'm using the following link:

# Progress 1: Data Preprocessing
It includes:
1. Importing the Dataset
2. Missing Data fixation
3. Categorical Data
4. Splitting the Dataset into the Training set and Test set
5. Feature Scaling
6. Data Preprocessing Template

Missing Data Problem?

In real life we encounter a lot of missing data. 
Removing the whole row could be dangerous as it may contains the important information.
To fix this problem, there are tricks which we apply:

Solution 1: Taking the mean of the whole column

# Categorical Data

In machine learning, we have equations which required values. Keeping the english alphabates it is very difficult. 
So we substitute the values.
